# HS698-project: Flask Application on Mass Spectrum Data Analysis Using PymzML

A mass spectrum is an ion signal intensity vs. m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) plot representing a chemical analysis. This project use Flask application to build a webpage where users can upload their own `.mzML` files and simply select the desired analyses offered by pymaML(https://pymzml.github.io/). 

The following are the options for mass spectrum data analysis:
  1. Finding a peak
  2. Plotting a spectrum
  3. Compare Spectra
  4. Highest peaks
  5. Extract a specific Ion Chromatogram
  6. Accessing the original XML Tree of a spectrum
  7. Write mzML
